# Modern-JavaScript---Build-15-Projects
In this project I study and exploit the fundament parts of javascript by creating 15 modern projects. At the end of this program, I will create another project to use Jquery as the library to make it simplier to understand. I hope you go through these projects and enjoy the work. I will add some functionality since this is an online course an I have some basic knowledge about JavaScript.
